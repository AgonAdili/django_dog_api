This is a simple project created using Django and Django REST Framework.

In order to start the application, you have to open it in a code editor, such as Visual Code, PyCharm or anything similar to these. Then, in order for the project to start successfully, you need to install django, django rest framework and pillow.

In the terminal of the code editor, you need to write:

_**pip install django**_

#this command will install django.

_**pip install djangorestframework**_

#this command will install the Django REST framework.

_**pip install pillow**_

#this command will install pillow, which is needed for the image files.

After installing them, you can start the application from the terminal by writing:

_**python manage.py runserver**_

#this command will start the application.

You can check the application from your browser by opening http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and you can test the application by opening the url path types provided in the urls.py file.

The browser will reload automatically if any changes are made and saved in the code.
